Step 1-
In the file lulesh.h there is a section which looks like-
//FTS_Project
//#define DUMP_POSX 
//#define DUMP_POSY 
//#define DUMP_POSZ 
//#define DUMP_DETERM 
//#define RUN_POSY_ASSERTION 
//endFTS_Project

By default all the above defines are commented. Uncomment only one, corresponding to the variable you want to dump. RUN_POSY_ASSERTION runs with the embedded assertion for variable domain.y. Uncomment this if you want to see the output of this.

Step 2-
Create a directory called 'data' within the dir lulesh
The dumped variables are stored in this directory. 

Step 3-
make clean
make

Step 4 (optional to ensure that MPI is added to the lib path)-
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/mpich2-gcc/1.4.1p1/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Step 5-
mpiexec -n 8 ./lulesh2.0 -s <problem size/int>
ex- mpiexec -n 8 ./lulesh2.0 -s 6
