This folder has 3 files

main.m- This file has to be modified as described below
getFeat2.m- This generates feature vectors to feed to the neural net
plot_roc- plots the roc given the errors for positive and negetive test samples.



Step 1-
Before running main.m copy the dumped variable across each problem size and append it as one file-
For example, if you are working on problem size 6, you can store all the inputs in a variable called problem size 6 and run the following command. This would read the csv files from all the processors and put the data in the matrix 'ips6'

ips6=[load('0_var.csv') load('1_var.csv') load('2_var.csv') load('3_var.csv') load('4_var.csv') load('5_var.csv') load('6_var.csv') load('7_var.csv')];

Repeat this step for all the problem sizes you wish to work on.



Step 2-
generate features for each of the 'ips' using the function 'getFeat2'. Store the output of this function into a variable feat. Ex-
feat_temp = getFeat2(ips6,6);
feat=getFeat2(ips5,5);

Repeat this for all the problem sizes. See 'main.m' for reference.



Step 3-
Change the following values in main.m and run the code
hiddenLayerSize = 5;
persForTest=0.005;
